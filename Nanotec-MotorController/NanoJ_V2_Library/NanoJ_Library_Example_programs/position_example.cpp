//This example shows how to use the nanotec.h
//In this example the motor is started in profile position mode
//Digital Input 1 activates a new target position
//Digital Input 2 selects if a new target position should be relative or absolute
//Digital Input 3 selects if a new target position should be changed immediately or after the last target position was reached
//Digital Input 4 switches between two speeds (slow/fast)
//Digital Input 5 switches between two target positions (1000/4000)
//Digital Input 6 lets the motor perform a quick-stop
//Digital Output 1 is set or cleared depending on whether the last target has been reached
